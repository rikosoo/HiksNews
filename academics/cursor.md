Title: Don't get hacked: Use this "Vibe Security" skill before you launch!


Every time I get close to launching an app, I get that massive wave of "launch anxiety." 
I'm always nervous I've made some stupid security mistake that's going to get me cooked on X/twitter.

I've been looking for a way to actually protect my apps from the common vulnerabilities without having to deal with the security concepts myself.

After trying a lot of different prompts/skills, I finally came across this repo and it's been a lifesaver:

https://github.com/BehiSecc/VibeSec-Skill

It basically make the LLM to think like a hacker. You can use it to audit existing code or write secure code.

Thank me later :)
